    It was about {numbers[0]} {measure_of_time} ago when I arrived at the hospital in a {mode_of_transportation}. 
    The hospital is a/an {adjectives[0]} place, there are a lot of {adjectives[1]} {nouns[0]} here.
    There are nurses here who have {color} {part_of_body}. If someone wants to come into my room I told them 
    that they have to {verb} first. I’ve decorated my room with {numbers[1]} {nouns[1]}. Today I talked to a doctor and 
    they were wearing a {nouns[2]} on their {part_of_body_2}. I heard that all doctors {verb} {nouns[3]} every day for 
    breakfast. The most {adjectives[2]} thing about being in the hospital is the {silly_word} {nouns[0]}!

    Dear {person_name}, I am writing to you from a {adjectives[0]} castle in an enchanted forest. I
